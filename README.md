[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/meteoinfo/community](https://badges.gitter.im/meteoinfo/community/meteoinfo.svg)](https://gitter.im/meteoinfo/community)

Installation
------------

MeteoInfo need to be pre-installed. The MeteoInfo and IMEP can be downloaded from 
http://www.meteothink.org/downloads/index.html. Unzip and copy "imep" folder into "MeteoInfo -> toolbox" folder.

Features
--------

IMEP is a model evaluation toolbox of MeteoInfo. The methods of ``continuous``, ``dichotomous``, 
``multicategory`` and ``score`` are supported. 

Running
-------

IMEP jython script can be running in MeteoInfoLab environment.

Example
-------

Continuous and dichotomous verification:

```python
import imep

datadir = 'D:/MyProgram/java/MeteoInfoDev/toolbox/IMEP/imep/sample'
fn = os.path.join(datadir, 'ex1.csv')
table = DataFrame.read_table(fn, delimiter=',', format='%3i%5f%i')
obs = table['Obs'].values
fcst = table['GFSMean'].values

print 'Continuous verification...'
cmethod = imep.verifymethod(method='continuous')
ctable = imep.verifytable(obs, fcst, cmethod)
print ctable

print 'Dichotomous verification...'
dr = imep.datarange(min=8)    # >= 8
dmethod = imep.verifymethod(method='dichotomous', drange=dr)
dtable = imep.verifytable(obs, fcst, dmethod)
print dtable
```
    
Output from the script:

```python
>>> run script...
